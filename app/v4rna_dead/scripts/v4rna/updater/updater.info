Step #1: Generate DSA Key Pair

Use ssh-keygen command as follows:
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
Output:

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vivek/.ssh/id_dsa): Press [Enter] key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): myPassword
Enter same passphrase again: myPassword
Your identification has been saved in /home/vivek/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/vivek/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
04:be:15:ca:1d:0a:1e:e2:a7:e5:de:98:4f:b1:a6:01 vivek@vivek-desktop

Caution: a) Please enter a passphrase different from your account password and confirm the same.
b) The public key is written to /home/you/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
c) The private key is written to /home/you/.ssh/id_dsa.
d) It is important you never-ever give out your private key.
Step #2: Set directory permission

Next make sure you have correct permission on .ssh directory:
$ cd
$ chmod 755 .ssh
Step #3: Copy public key

Now copy file ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub on Machine #1 (tom) to remote server jerry as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub user@jerry:.ssh/authorized_keys
Command to type on your remote server called jerry

Login to your remote server and make sure permissions are set correct:
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Task: How do I login from client to server with DSA key?

Use scp or ssh as follows from your local computer:
$ ssh user@jerry
$ ssh user@remote-server.com
$ scp file user@jerry:/tmp
