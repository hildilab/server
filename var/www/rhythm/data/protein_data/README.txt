H-Nr
Helix-number; internal number of the transmembran helix, when all secondary structures are numbered consecutively	

AAId	
Identifier of the current amino acid (number and chain Id)

AA	
type of amino acid (one-letter-code)

I/A
identifier, whether the amino acid (Ca-atom) is inside or outside of the membrane;
1: Ca-atom is between both membrane planes	
0: Ca-atom is outside the membrane planes	

ges
number of atoms of the current amino acid	

Kont	
number of atoms of the current amino acid with any contact outside the own helix 	

Memb	
number of atoms of the current amino acid with contacts to the virtual membrane	
(outside within the both membraneplanes)

Hel	
number of atoms of the current amino acid with contacts to other helices	

H2O	 
number of atoms of the current amino acid with contacts to the virtual water	
(outside without the both membraneplanes - can only be at start or end of the helix)
