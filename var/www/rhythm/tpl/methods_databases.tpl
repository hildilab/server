The <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Pfam database</a> is an extensive set of protein domains and families. Each family consists of a multiple alignment of functionally or evolutionary related protein sequences. These alignments also reproduce faint evolutionary relationships that would not be detectable with other methods. The current Pfam release (version 23.0, August 2008) has especially updated the coverage of proteins with known protein structure  [{'pfam'|ref}].

   The formation of helix-helix contacts is crucial for membrane protein folding. Residues involved in helix-helix contacts are therefore evolutionary conserved. This conservation can be applied to predict buried vs. exposed residues [{'punta07'|ref}]. In the two data sets <b>60% - 70%</b> of the conserved residues account for helix-helix contacts, while only <b>14% - 18%</b> account for helix-membrane contacts. The remaining residues account i.e. for water-contacts or packing defects [{'hildebrand05'|ref}]. Only fully conserved residues are considered.

      For searching the Pfam database <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/" target="_blank">HMMER</a> (current version 2.3.2, October 2003) is used. HMMER allows for sensitive searching in a database of protein family's consensus supplied as a profile hidden Markov model version [{'hmmer'|ref}]. 
      <br/>
      For our purpose the Pfam database was restricted to membrane protein families to allow faster searches. To achieve this the Pfam <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/search/keyword" target="_blank">keyword search</a> was used to generate a reduced database of entries predominantly containing membrane proteins.
