	<td valign="top"><br>FragFit is an interactive web service for guided modeling of missing segments such as loops or hige regions into cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps.
    Segments of up to 3-35 residues length can be effectively modeled into maps of different resolution. Fragments are taken from a precalculated and frequently updated database extracted from structural coordinates deposited in the PDB. <br>
    A fast hierarchical search algorithm selects up to 100 suitable fragments by using sequence similarity and geometrical fitting as evaluation criteria. The found fragments are then reranked by their cross-correlation to the user provided cryo-EM density map.  </td>
	<td valign="top"><br>
    MDsrv is a web-based tool developed to enhance collaborative research by providing non-experts with easy and quick on-line access to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. <br>
    As a member of the nglviewer family, MDsrv channels MD trajectories through a web server using a powerful web application (NGL viewer) to visualize them. </td>

    We work on the elucidation of the conformational space of GPCRs and its modulation by extracellular ligands and intracellular effector proteins by means of classical and umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to address the issues of signaling specificity and biased signaling.
<br> For this reason we are computational modelling receptor G protein or arrestin interactions to elucidate the mechanism of signal transduction.</td>

    SuperLooper2 is an interactive web service for the insertion of missing segments such as loops in proteins. <br>
    Loop candidates are selected from a precalculated database containing ~700 million protein fragments with a residue length of 3-35. The fragments are extracted from structural coordinates deposited in the RSCB PDB.

  <td valign="top"><br>The ValiDen webserver generates electron density maps. As a highlighting feature ValiDen provides the opportunity to convert the formats of electron microscopy maps (e.g. CCP4, X-PLOR, DSN6, BRIX) via the program MAPMAN in feasible map formats (e.g. MAP) for representation of EM-maps in e.g. COOT or PyMOL.</td>

  Voronoia4RNA is a database storing data on atomic packing densities of RNA structures and complexes.
  Compared to other methods, that solely estimate van der Waals interactions i.e. by gain of solvent excluded surfaces, Voronoia4RNA allocates the free space between neighbouring atoms.
  <br>It explicitly takes packing defects into consideration and is therefore an appropriate method to calculate van der Waals interactions and to estimate the underlying forces. </td>
